# What is it?

ADMINLTE for Blazor is a collection of reusable components, with which you can easily develop digital services as a designer or developer. Think of buttons, form elements and page templates. This project adapts ADMINLTE 3 so the components can be used from dotnet core Blazor.

For a quick impression visite the **demo site** at: https://blazorize-adminlte.morstead.nl/

# Status

The project is in early stage currently, but expanded almost daily. Feel free to follow the project and receive updates as they arrive.
**Note** that components and their naming conventions might change until a major version is released.

We also provide various integrations in a seperate project, to help you started with more complex web applications Here:

## Getting Started


Depending on running WASM or Server, change your 
[`index.html`](./src/Blazor.AdminLte.Wasm/wwwroot/index.html) or
[`_Host.cshtml`](./src/Blazor.AdminLte.Site/Pages/_Host.cshtml).
Contents from the Blazor Component Library are served from : `_content/Blazor.AdminLte`

The site shared components [`MainLayout.razor`](./src/Blazor.AdminLte.Site.Shared/MainLayout.razor) includes markup that shows how to setup your starter page in Blazor.

With such markup you can render something like this:

## Logged by Grammy

1. Issue of ResolveBlazorRuntimeDependencies failure was met in the first try of build. Upgraded VS2019 to the latest update then issue gone.
2. Default ports 5000/5001 of Blazor.AdminLte.Site might be used by other process. Modified it to random ports then both LiveReload and .NETCore emulators worked.
